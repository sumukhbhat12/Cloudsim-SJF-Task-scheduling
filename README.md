# Cloudsim-SJF-Task-scheduling college project

SJF Scheduling paper is the paper from which the modified sjf algorithm is implemented.
Replace the DatacenterBroker.java file in the cloudsim simulator with the DatacenterBroker.java file from the above folder for the corresponding scheduling algorithms.
Copy and Paste the simulation.java file into the Examples directory in the cloudsim folder.
run the simulation.java file in eclipse.

DatacenterBroker.java file present in the FCFS folder is the default FCFS scheduling algorithm found in cloudsim simulator.
DatacenterBroker.java file present in the SJF folder is the regular SJF algorithm implementation for the cloudsim.
DatacenterBroker.java file present in the Modified SJF folder is the improved SJF algorithm implemented from the Research Paper.

#What method has been changed?

the changes in the code is in submitCloudlets() method of DatacenterBroker.java file
